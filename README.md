## HW2 New features

Things added in this revision include a filter for an amount and a filter for a category.
To apply these filters they need to be filled with valid categories or amounts, enter needs to be pressed to confirm the text, and the checkbox needs to be checked.
Both filters can be applied at the same time.
New filters can be added by adding new implementations of the Transaction filter, adding the components to the view and adding event listeners to the App for these components.
